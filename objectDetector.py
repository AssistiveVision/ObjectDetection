# Main
# load yolov3 model

# The model expects inputs to be color images with the square shape of 416Ã—416 pixels.

# define the expected input shape for the model
input_w, input_h = 416, 416
# define our new photo
photo_filename = 'zebra.jpg'
# load and prepare image
image, image_w, image_h = load_image_pixels(photo_filename, (input_w, input_h))

# make prediction

# summarize the shape of the list of arrays

# [(1, 13, 13, 255), (1, 26, 26, 255), (1, 52, 52, 255)]
# returns a list of three NumPy arrays, the shape of which is displayed as output.
# These arrays predict both the bounding boxes and class labels but are encoded. They must be interpreted.
